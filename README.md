On average males earn more than females. Avearge purchase of bikes relative to average earned by households (both genders) is good and relatively high. 


CATEGORY 2
AGE CATEGORY OF BIKE PURCHASED
From the diagram, the targeted age category should be adult as the highest number of revenue comes from that category. Adolescents purchased 71 bikes (the least of the category of the survey), the highest return came from the category of adults and faced a sharp decline with less elderly buying bikes.
To increase revenue, the targeted age category should be adult as the highest number of revenue comes that category as this group accounted for 38% of purchase which is a third of total purchase. Alternatively, adolescents can be encouraged to purchase more bikes through advertisement as these adolescent grow up to be adult, they can serve as retained customer as they have long time before turning elderly.


CATEGORY 3
